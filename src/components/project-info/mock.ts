human psychology to promote environmental sustainability. Global
interconnectivity has given rise to some of the most positively
disruptive technology in human history but is causing
environmental degradation. Crypto mining is now a trend that is
being used to incentivize the use of sustainable energy. CRL is a
deflationary token that rewards its holders with passive income
for holding the tokens. CRL Token team is actively exploring
existing carbon offset options and services to leverage on-chain
incentives and to demonstrate greenifying carbon emissions.CRL
Token team intends to diversify the platform's portfolio with
green offsetting assets. CRL uses existing business models to
validate the efficacy of green investments. CRL algorithm helps to
protect users' investment by ensuring liquidity in the platform.
CRL's liquidity injection from transactional redistribution helps
to stabilize the overall value of the CRL token, ensuring its
sustainability.`;
